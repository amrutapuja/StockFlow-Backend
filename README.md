# StockFlow-Backend
StockFlow Backend is a RESTful API for **inventory and product management**.  
It allows companies to manage products, warehouses, suppliers, and sales, while also providing **low-stock alerts**.  
Built with **Flask + SQLAlchemy + MySQL**, this project demonstrates backend system design with clean APIs and database integration.
